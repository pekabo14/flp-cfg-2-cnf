# Project 1 in FLP course - cfg-2-cnf #

Project is about convert Context-free grammar into Chomsky normal form or remove simple rules from grammar.

I implemented all requirements in project assignment and nothing more.

### How to run ###

It needs to build with help of Makefile with command ```make``` in root directory of project

* ```./bkg-2-cnf {-i | -1 | -2} FILENAME``` or use stdin to write input

### Tests ###

I used tests which were included in project assignment.
